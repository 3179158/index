            <b>1. &nbsp;Where do you stand with the two ideological camps: flat and skeuo? <br> For example, do you think one is "better" than the other or do you strongly believe in one or the other.</b>
            <br><br> Flat and skeuo are not necessarily ideological schools of thought, but aesthetic preferences. Today the flatter skeuo design is more trendy. Every physical object is becoming more flat and more compact. Designs have also become more
            minimal and flat. This goes hand in hand with the culture of convenience weâ€™re living in, where everything is available at our fingertips. The flat design takes us more out of reality. At the end of the day both are purely aesthetic designs
            and do not effect the function of a software or product. However it is more and more prevalent for form to be prioritized over function. This is a marketing tactic too; if something looks pleasing to the eye, it must be better quality. That
            is not the case. Seuko aims to connect us more to reality whereas flat design removes us more from reality. Neither is worse per se, but rather the context and way it is used in. Design is more simplistic now which correlates with everything
            becoming more simplistic and infantilizing. Design, technology, art, and culture are no longer challenging. If Seuko became the trendy design aesthetic once again it would not change this.

            <b>2. &nbsp;What is a zoopraxiscope and how does it relate to web and interaction design? Find another example from filmmaking or another medium that has inspired digital design.</b>
            <br><br> A zoopraxiscope was an early motion picture projector invented by Eadweard Muybridge which utilized a glass disc with images or illustrations that would spin and project the lit images. The images would repeat in succession like a
            GIF does today. One artist that has influenced digital illustration today is Henri Matisse. The large portioned, Alegria figures used in advertisements today (mainly tech ads) use the same kind of round lines and exaggerated body proportions.
            Not too mention using the same colour palette. Pastel colours, orange, blue, pink and, yellow. Another influence is the Memphis movement, which was a furniture design movement which also used the same colour palette, curved lines and simplistic
            shapes.

            <b>3. &nbsp;Do you agree with that screens want "flux"? Explain why you do or do not.</b>
            <br><br>I agree that screens should incorporate some amount of flux. The flux that is most present that Chimero points out is medium flux this is what interfaces and websites use. It uses adaptable and descriptive animation on the screen.
            It visually shows the activity. It also allows the screen to use sensors to intuitively change to screen to fit the context and location. In certain lighting conditions it is useful to have the screen adapt to it. As well as certain times
            during the day when nightshift is used to turn off blue light. This has a physical effect on the eyes rather than just being a design component. In certain situations the screen can also change from light to dark mode which can cause less
            strain on the eyes and make the content easier to view. In some situations it might not be necessary such as app opening and closing animations or the parallax effect. These seem to just be a visual representation and not practical in any
            other way. They tend to take up time and storage space. </p>
