            <b>1. &nbsp;In the opening paragraph of her post, Seu asks you, the reader to join her to 'defamiliarize our tools.' What do you think she means by that? And how do you think that action relates to her use of the word poetry?</b>
            <br><br> When Seu tells the reader to “defamiliarize our tools” she means we should look at our tools and technology differently. She states most people use their tools in an automated and intended way. In this article she wants people to
            break away from that and venture into a more unorthodox way of imagining the tools. Technology is usually seen as utilitarian without any creativity or thought given to it. These tools can be utilized and seen in a more thoughtful way. Seu
            mentions how in exhibitions people engage with new technologies superficially and with no further thought. She later on states that knowing the constraints of these tools can lead to “poetic potential.” The limited capabilities of these can
            be manipulated to create artistic works.
            <br><br><br><br>
            <b>2. &nbsp;Seu outlines 6 categories within her taxonomy of tool poetics (Slow Growth & Slow Death, Early Works, Performing Data, Removing Function from Form, Production of Errors, & Regeneration). Choose at least one of these categories and define it in your own words. Now find a website or online interface* not mentioned in her post that you feel operates within the chosen definition. Explain why.</b>
            <br><br> Early Works, as the name suggests are works that appeared in the early age of computer technology. They were made with the limited functions of the time. They engage the viewer and make them interact in a slower, less intuitive way
            with them. Hacker Typer as a simple concept, to appear like the stereotypical screens of hackers in movies, most notably the 1995 movie, Hackers. Although the site was made in 2011 it has the appearance of something from the late 80s to early
            2000s. When the internet used to be less intuitive and actions had to be performed manually rather than through a simple point and click of a button. The page also looks like a system’s console where you would type commands to perform functions.
            Computer consoles have been similar in use and aesthetic since the early computer days.
