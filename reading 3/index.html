            <b>1. &nbsp;What do you think is Lialina's opinion of the word "user"?</b>
            <br><br>Lialina opens by saying that nowadays technology is meant to simply be functional without any thought going into the mechanics of it. “User” has been replaced with “experience.” Tech companies want to drop the word user and think of
            them just as people. This makes it appear as if they want to humanize the consumers of these products. It is not necessary to humanize the users of technology. The term “user” reminds people that they are using a product, that there is a degree
            of separation from them and the computer/system. The user did not program the system themselves. A developer programmed it and by utilizing “user” this is highlighted. I agree ultimately. Tech companies try to mask their intentions and seem
            as human and innocuous as possible. This is dangerous because it does not allow users to retain their rights or be privy to what these tech companies are doing. What Lialina says about the erasure of developers is similar to the idea of “commodity
            fetishism.” This is when consumers believe objects are inherently magical and disregard the people who made it and the process of making it. Since systems are not tangible objects this is more the case.
            <br><br><br><br>
            <b>2. &nbsp;What is Lialina's ideal internet user? Provide some of the qualities that she outlines.</b>
            <br><br> Lialina’s ideal internet user is a “general purpose user.” A general purpose user is a user that use systems for as the name suggests, general use. They will use different applications and websites for different functions. They can
            do things without specified apps for specific functions. They are able to adapt to any system for their needs. They have the “ability to achieve their goals regardless of the primary device.” Users have their own autonomy. Another quality
            a user must posses is mindfulness. They should know how something functions and that everything was developed by people. They should also be mindful of the (human) errors and be able to fill in gaps themselves.
            <br><br><br><br>
            <b>3. &nbsp;From your own experiences interacting on the web—what is an example where there are "gaps that can be filled by users"?</b>
            <br><br>The area where I encounter the biggest online gaps is online shopping. On Google there is a search option called “shopping.” The results there are usually limited, non existent, or irrelevant. The better alternative is to look through
            images and click the sites with the “product” tag on them. The issue with this method is that a product could be shown as in stock on images but then as out of stock on the website. There are also price and shipping price discrepancies. When
            it comes to certain products some websites don’t list all the details such as ingredients. They have to be searched and read on separate websites. There are even a lack of product shots even, which need to be Googled to view. When finalizing
            a purchase a shipping address must be manually typed rather than having it automatically entered from location detection. All this is to say, online shopping is meant be the more convenient option. When in reality it takes a lot more steps
            to shop online versus in store.
